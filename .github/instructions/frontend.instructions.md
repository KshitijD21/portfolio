## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Problem Analysis (Sequential Thinking)

1. **Break down requests** into smaller, manageable components
2. **Identify dependencies** between different portfolio sections
3. **Plan implementation order** based on priority and dependencies
4. **Consider responsive design** from the beginning

### Step 2: Memory Management

After each iteration, store:

- **Design decisions** and reasoning
- **Component choices** and their justification
- **Performance considerations** applied
- **Accessibility features** implemented
- **User feedback** and requested changes

### Step 3: Documentation Lookup (Context7)

Before implementing, check:

- **Latest Next.js 15 features** and best practices
- **New shadcn/ui components** and patterns
- **Magic UI examples** for inspiration
- **Tailwind CSS v4 utilities** and configuration
