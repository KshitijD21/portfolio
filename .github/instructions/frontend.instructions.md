## Development Workflow

### Step 1: Problem Analysis (Sequential Thinking)

1. **Break down requests** into smaller, manageable components
2. **Identify dependencies** between different portfolio sections
3. **Plan implementation order** based on priority and dependencies
4. **Consider responsive design** from the beginning

### Step 2: Memory Management

After each iteration, store:

- **Design decisions** and reasoning
- **Component choices** and their justification
- **Performance considerations** applied
- **Accessibility features** implemented
- **User feedback** and requested changes

### Step 3: Documentation Lookup (Context7)

Before implementing, check:

- **Latest Next.js 15 features** and best practices
- **New shadcn/ui components** and patterns
- **Magic UI examples** for inspiration
- **Tailwind CSS v4 utilities** and configuration

### Step 4: Implementation

- Follow **Next.js App Router** patterns
- Use **Server Components** where appropriate
- Implement **Client Components** only when necessary
- Apply **shadcn/ui** for core components
- Enhance with **Magic UI** for animations
- Ensure **Tailwind CSS v4** best practices

### Step 5: Automated Testing (Playwright MCP)

After every implementation iteration:

1. **Create Testing Plan**:

   - Define specific test scenarios for the implemented feature
   - Plan responsive testing across different viewport sizes
   - Outline accessibility and contrast checks

2. **Execute Playwright Tests**:

   - Use **Playwright MCP only** - never install locally or via npm test - Validate responsive design on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
   - Test both light and dark mode themes

3. **Visual Testing**:

   - Take screenshots in both light and dark modes
   - Check color contrast ratios for accessibility compliance
   - Verify component layouts at different screen sizes
   - Capture before/after comparisons for design changes

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure Core Web Vitals during tests
   - Verify loading performance across different network conditions
   - Test image optimization and lazy loading behavior

## Best Practices to Follow

### Next.js 15 Specific

- Use **App Router** exclusively
- Leverage **Server Components** for better performance
- Implement **Streaming** for improved loading
- Use **generateMetadata** for dynamic SEO
- Apply **Image optimization** with next/image
